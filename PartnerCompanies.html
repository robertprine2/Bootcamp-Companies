			<p>"Standard and Simple - Make things as easy as possible for your customer. Give them software that is simple to use and implement, be transparent about your products and services, and offer a good Self-Service Portal that boosts customer independence."</p>
			<p>"Shared Service Management - No department is an island. Your customers rely on IT, facilities and other services – with each handlingrequests in their own way. Save your customers a lot of hassle by offering a single point of contact, and even by sharing your processes. With all departments on the same page, communication with your customers becomes more straightforward, and makes your services easier to manage."</p>
			<p>"Service Integration Management - Your department probably works with suppliers. But if they let you down, you may let your customers down. That’s why it’s important to collaborate effectively with your suppliers. How? Start by integrating your tools. This helps both parties manage agreements and stay up-to-date. If you improve the relationship with your supplier, everyone will benefit."</p>
